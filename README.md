## Description
All vectorization and visualization results were generated using open-source AI libraries (`gensim`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`).
The textual corpus is based on the CBETA (Chinese Buddhist Electronic Text Association) digital canon, used under its Creative Commons license.

This repository ensures transparency and reproducibility for an interdisciplinary study that connects early Buddhist epistemology (*avyākṛta*, *vohāra*, *paññatti*) with modern AI pattern recognition, illustrating how both function as *upāyas* (skillful means) to reveal the relational emptiness of language.
